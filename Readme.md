# ðŸŽ“ Graduate Admission Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project builds a **Linear Regression model** to predict a studentâ€™s chance of admission to a graduate program based on academic and personal attributes. It demonstrates a complete data science workflow from data exploration to model training and evaluation.Linear Regression model is one of the simplest predictive model in Machine Learning. It predicts by deriving a straight-line formula based on the data fit on it. But as simple as it is, Linear Regression can still be an effective model such as in use-cases like this.

##  Project Motivation

In today's competitive academic environment, many students seek to understand how their profile affects graduate school admissions. This project aims to:

- Identify the most influential factors (CGPA, GRE, Research, etc.)
- Provide a predictive model for estimating admission chances
- Demonstrate an end-to-end regression use case in Python

The dataset is publicly available on GitHub/Kaggle and contains 500 samples with the following attributes:

| Feature              | Description                             |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| GRE Score            | Graduate Record Examination (out of 340) |
| TOEFL Score          | TOEFL score (out of 120)                 |
| University Rating    | Rating from 1 to 5                       |
| SOP                  | Statement of Purpose Strength (1â€“5)      |
| LOR                  | Letter of Recommendation Strength (1â€“5)  |
| CGPA                 | Undergraduate GPA (out of 10)            |
| Research             | Research experience (0 = No, 1 = Yes)    |
| Chance of Admit      | Target variable (probability between 0â€“1)|

##  Techniques Used

-  Data Preprocessing (`pandas`, `numpy`)
-  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
-  Feature Correlation & Trend Analysis
-  Model Training using `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`
-  Evaluation Metrics: RÂ² Score, MAE, MSE, RMSE
-  Residual Analysis & Regression Plots

##  Key Results & Insights

- The **CGPA** and **GRE Score** were the most influential predictors.
- **Research Experience** and **University Rating** also had noticeable effects.
- The model achieved an **RÂ² Score of approximately 0.82**, indicating strong predictive power.
